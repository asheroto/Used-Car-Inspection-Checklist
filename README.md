# Used Car Inspection Checklist
This is a generic list of things to check before purchasing a used car.  Feel free to suggest changes.

### Before starting the car, while the engine is cool:

1. Check radiator fluid - look under the radiator cap and the overflow resevoir. Can you see clean antifreeze? (Usually bright green - some cases red) If you can’t see any fluid it could indicate a small unknown leak somewhere. If the fluid is cloudy and dirty there could be a head gasket leak.

2. Check the oil level. Is the oil level where it should be on the dip stick? If it’s not, that shows signs of poor maintenance and likely oil leak. Is the oil clean - not cloudy? Cloudy oil is a sign of water contamination - and water is not a good thing to be inside of an engine.

3. Look under the engine bay for signs of oil leaks. If it drips to the ground after sitting for half day to full day - that’s too much of an oil leak. Hopefully the owner showing the car hasn’t recently moved the car. Look on the ground AND up on the engine and oil pan areas.

### Exterior Walk-through

1. Tire tread - tires should have an even wear to them. If any of the tread is wearing unevenly it could possibly need something as simple as an alignment ($80) or something worse like major suspension component repair (upwards of $1000 or more)

2. Paint job - look for signs of fresh paint possibly covering up damage or accident repair. Any signs of bondo / body filler repair work?

3. Look under rocker panels and various under carriage areas for signs of rust. Rust is car cancer. Once it starts, the car will eventually be dead.

4. Turn on all lights, blinkers, etc - check to make sure all signals / lights work. If more than 1 bulb is out, it’s could be more than just burnt out bulbs, it could be an underlying electrical issue.

### While test driving - moving and/or parked with engine running

1. Any funky noises when accelerating? When braking? When turning sharply?

2. Does it idle smoothly under 1000 RPMS? It should idle somewhere between 500-1000 RPMS.

3. Is the check engine light on? If so stop by an O’Rielley’s, AutoZone, or Advance auto parts and they can check the check engine light code for you for free.

4. While the car is parked, engine running, look at the exhaust pipe. Any smoke coming from it? Blue’gray smoke could mean it’s burning too rich on fuel. If it’s black smoke it’s burning a significant amount of oil. Do you see significant soot on the car body around the exhaust pipe? If so - that’s signs of burning oil too. (Burning oil = gasket leak = the engine’s on it’s last leg)

5. Is the steering wheel straight while driving straight down the road? It should - if not there could be alignment or suspension issues

6. If you take your hands off the wheel, will it drive straight down the road? It should - if not there could be alignment or suspension issues

7. Does the AC work? If not consider it could cost upwards of $500-1000 to replace an AC compressor worst case scenario. On older 90s/80s model cars it could be the older kind of freon and need a complete system overhaul before the AC can be fixed which could be even more $.

8. Heater & defrost work?

9. Mileage - nothing wrong with having over 200,000 miles as long as it’s been maintained properly. Do they have maintenance records? Is there an oil change sticker in the upper left corner of the windshield with the mileage at which an oil change should be done - compare it to the mileage on the odometer. Depending on the make and model of the car it will either have a timing chain or a timing belt. Look this up online to know if the car you’re looking at has a timing belt or a chain. I prefer timing chains. Timing belts typically should be replaced every 100,000 miles and it is usually $500-1000 to have a timing belt replaced. If it is not replaced, and it breaks, then your engine is probably going to be toast. So is the mileage showing it’s due for a new timing belt? Ask the owner if it’s been replaced.

10. Transmission - does it shift smoothly and on time when driving normally - what about when driving fast?
